This receiver receives spans from [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/) (V1 and V2).

## Getting Started

All that is required to enable the Zipkin receiver is to include it in the
receiver definitions.

```yaml
receivers:
  zipkin:
```

The following settings are configurable:

### Legacy Configuration (Deprecated)

- `endpoint` (default = localhost:9411): host:port on which the receiver is going to receive data. See our [security best practices doc](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/security/config-best-practices/#protect-against-denial-of-service-attacks) to understand how to set the endpoint in different environments. For full list of `ServerConfig` refer [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/config/confighttp).
- `parse_string_tags` (default = false): if enabled, the receiver will attempt to parse string tags/binary annotations into int/bool/float.

### Protocol-Based Configuration

Starting from v0.128.0, the zipkin receiver supports a protocol-based configuration format:

```yaml
receivers:
  zipkin:
    protocols:
      http:
        endpoint: localhost:9411
    parse_string_tags: false
```

Currently, only the HTTP protocol is supported, but this structure allows for future expansion to other protocols (such as UDP). The protocol-based design makes the receiver more extensible and follows the pattern used by other receivers in the OpenTelemetry Collector.

#### Future Protocol Support

The architecture has been designed to easily add support for additional protocols in the future. For example, a UDP protocol could be added with configuration like:

```yaml
receivers:
  zipkin:
    protocols:
      http:
        endpoint: localhost:9411
      # UDP support is not yet implemented, this is just an example
      # udp:
      #   endpoint: localhost:9412
    parse_string_tags: false
```

The legacy configuration format is still supported for backward compatibility, but it is recommended to use the new protocol-based configuration format for new deployments.

## Advanced Configuration

Several helper files are leveraged to provide additional capabilities automatically:

- [HTTP server settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/confighttp/README.md#server-configuration) including CORS
- [TLS and mTLS settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/configtls/README.md)
